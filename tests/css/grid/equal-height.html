                        the city in which we were camping was supposed to have been a center of commerce and culture known
                        as Korad. It had been built upon a beautiful, natural harbor, landlocked by magnificent hills. The
                        little valley on the west front of the city, she explained, was all that remained of the harbor,
                        while the pass through the hills to the old sea bottom had been the channel through which the shipping
                        passed up to the city's gates.
